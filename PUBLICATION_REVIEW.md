# Publication Review — nora-retrieval

**Status: BLOCKED**

This review is fail-closed. A scaffold cannot pass it merely because required files exist.

## Result

  G3/G4 privacy/secret scans, G6 contributor readiness: PASS with evidence (2026-08-20).
- G5 licensing/provenance: LICENSE + SOURCE_PROVENANCE.yaml present, but formal external
  rights review still recorded as `pending_formal_rights_review`.
- G7 remote CI/security: ci workflow PASS on pushed main; codeql SARIF upload BLOCKED
  ("Advanced Security must be enabled for this repository to use code scanning" — GitHub
