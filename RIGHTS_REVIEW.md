# Rights / Provenance Review Register — nora-retrieval

**Gate:** G5 (licensing/provenance) — **STATUS: BLOCKED**

**Review executed 2026-08-20.** Every lineage entry below received an evidence-based disposition
(verified via GitHub API commit/license checks, candidate git-history searches, and harvest-commit
file inspection). BLOCKED entries may not be treated as cleared until a named human reviewer
records a decision. This register is the durable record.

## Verification record (2026-08-20)

- Source commits checked with `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}`.
- Source licenses checked with `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/license` and by reading the LICENSE
  file at the recorded commit.
- Contamination search (`git log --all -S`) across this repo for: RAGEmbed, Meridian-Canon,
  NECCL, nora-canon, blakeox, legal-mcp, LawLLama, CC BY-NC, courtlistener-mcp, mcro-mcp,
  agent-canon → **0 hits** (the only `RAGEmbed` string in history is this repo's own G5 register
  commit `5806b72` — a doc mention, not migrated code).
- Harvested files inspected at harvest commits (`git show`): small derived implementations
  importing `nora_retrieval` contracts, docstring-attributed to sources; not verbatim copies.
  No vendor directories.
- Evidence artifacts: `/tmp/g5deep.log`, `/tmp/g5verify.log`, `/tmp/g5ev_nora-retrieval.log`.
